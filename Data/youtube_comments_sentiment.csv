I ran into the same issues as you with my Hunter ceiling and Hue bulbs and played around a bit.  The way I did it was I left the fan in the room it’s supposed to be in (Master Bedroom in my case). I created a Shortcut (within HomeKit’s Convert To Shortcut) that turns the light power on when it’s turned off much like you did.  Since Hue doesn’t allow you to set a default of the bulb being off after power is cut, I made it so that the Hue bulbs in the fan turn on to 1% (so as not to get blasted in the retinas) after a power restore.  To make sure the The bulbs come back on while the Shortcut is being run, I have it wait three seconds then turn the bulbs off.

Ot does seem to me that you went way overkill on the light controls compared to how I ended up. For the wall switch, I just put a blank plate there. No reaching inside or any other way to force a change without a screwdriver. I also mounted the remote holder immediately next to the wall switch so anyone will see it there (it’s also in my master bedroom so there’s no unexpected foot traffic). Finally, I replaced the bulbs with those that are more friendly to dimming. Anything that controls the lights does so smoothly without causing unexpected power disruptions.

At 11:50 CPU temp = 31°C your curve show that you would be at 27% for you fan - rpm : 1240
it means that your fan maximum speed at 100% would be (1240/27)*100 = 4592rpm.
Its impossible to go at 4592rpm for classic fans then your rpm are wrong.

PG05pZ6S8w0,Competitors,"Shane, 

Love your videos, I’ve been watching you for a long time and you’ve helped me build my smart home! 

I’m about to go through a reno in my condo and I’m installing Hunter Aerodyne smart fans, I have single gang dumb switch where 1 switch controls both the light and the fan (originally there was no fan, it was just a light). I’ve watched a number of your videos on ceiling fans and smart switches and I’m still kind of confused what to do. 

I feel like a simple Lutron caseta diva dimmer switch could be the answer. It will control the light and prevent power from being cut to the light/fan. I will have full control of the light and fan via HomeKit/Siri and the Hunter app, so I don’t really need the switch to control them both. But I want a smart switch to prevent the power being cut to the device. 

What are your thoughts? 

Hope to hear back.

PG05pZ6S8w0,Competitors,"Hey Shane. coming from the Z wave (honestly possible with zigbee as well) world there's a great way to achieve what you want with the ""accidentally killing the light switch"" issue for those who want to use a relay or smart controller but still want to keep it WAF certified. for switches like Zooz and Inovelli that offer scene control. you can disable the internal relay so that physical button presses don't kill the power. this way you can press the top or bottom of the switch physically and tie those actions to the on/off respectively of the fan and/or light. it's a great alternative to keeping the house as user friendly as possible. plus in the event of say a power outage or something odd where you need to enable the physical relay for whatever reason, you can do this manually at the switch with no network communication required, just a series of button presses.",0,1.0,"Hey Shane. coming from the Z wave (honestly possible with zigbee as well) world there's a great way to achieve what you want with the ""accidentally killing the light switch"" issue for those who want to use a relay or smart controller but still want to keep it WAF certified. for switches like Zooz and Inovelli that offer scene control. you can disable the internal relay so that physical button presses don't kill the power. this way you can press the top or bottom of the switch physically and tie those actions to the on/off respectively of the fan and/or light. it's a great alternative to keeping the house as user friendly as possible. plus in the event of say a power outage or something odd where you need to enable the physical relay for whatever reason, you can do this manually at the switch with no network communication required, just a series of button presses.",Positive,Positive
PG05pZ6S8w0,Competitors,"I just recently modified a DC fan in our master bedroom. It’s a Harbor Breeze and they incorporate the controller into the top of the fan. It only had a single hot but the house was set up for separate wall switches. So when I originally installed it I had to cap one circuit and we couldn’t use the wall switch anymore…only the remote. 

I recently dropped the fan and ran a second hot line through the down rod and bypassed the light on the controller and wired it directly to the second circuit. 

Now the fan can be controlled independently with a smart wall switch (relay) and the light with a smart wall dimmer. So they can be controlled now from the wall again or home automation without having to locate the remote. Only caveat is you need the remote if you want to adjust the speed of the fan…but not that big of a deal and better than it was.

This is probably a silly question, if the fan has a remote why bother with all the wiring and switches

Wouldn’t it just be easy to use something like an Aqara M2 hub that (I’m pretty sure) has an IR blaster functionality blast the remote and then run scenes or shortcuts ? 

You then could have functionality over the light and fan on/off/speed regardless off AC/DC?

BWTPg5GqxsA,Competitors,"My two Hunter fans are hands down the worst smart home purchase I have ever made.

There is NO way to factory default the fans completely, and mine had been stuck in a state where they thought they were part of a HomeKit home, but HomeKit did not have any entities. Trying to add the fans would result in a ""This device already belongs to a HomeKit Home"" error, resetting did absolutely nothing.

I called Hunter Support and explained the issue, and the tech's first question was ""Are you using an Android phone or Apple phone?"" ... for a HomeKit issue...

After explaining multiple times, they ended up referring me to the developer of the app and fan software. He only works on certain days. He gave me a call, and because I was able to get the fan to connect to WIFI (attempting to add to HomeKit would reconnect the fan to WIFI, but not HomeKit), he was able to reset the fan from his side, allowing me to finally add the fan back to HomeKIt.

I constantly have to power off the fans and power them back on as they tend to not respond, even though I have no other issues with this and other devices in my home. These things make me nervous that one day they won't respond, I won't be able to fix the issue, then I'll have to go back through support to get the fan reset.

BWTPg5GqxsA,Competitors,"I loved this review, especially as I just installed a Hunter Romulus.

The combination of a great running fan with HomeKit automations means that my wife turn the fan on at the beginning of our sleep.

I don't care for the modern look as all of our furniture is antiques. I went with Hunter Builder Grade Ceiling fans with pull chains.

The Master Bedroom already had two switches controlling that ceiling fan. The Den had a 3-way switch for the light and a single switch for the fan.

T1wWKOwcjj8,Competitors,I am attempting to place this fan on a slanted ceiling that is fairly high. My old fan had a pin at the top and the outlet plate had the opening so you could mount in with the pin to the ceiling instead of using a mounting bracket like in the new kit. Do I still just attach it in that manner and use the mounting bracket just so I can fit the remote at the top. I bought a new down rod extension but if I use the mounting bracket that comes with the kit - my rod is at an angle if I do it that way.

PG05pZ6S8w0,Competitors,"Shane, 

Love your videos, I’ve been watching you for a long time and you’ve helped me build my smart home! 

I’m about to go through a reno in my condo and I’m installing Hunter Aerodyne smart fans, I have single gang dumb switch where 1 switch controls both the light and the fan (originally there was no fan, it was just a light). I’ve watched a number of your videos on ceiling fans and smart switches and I’m still kind of confused what to do. 

I feel like a simple Lutron caseta diva dimmer switch could be the answer. It will control the light and prevent power from being cut to the light/fan. I will have full control of the light and fan via HomeKit/Siri and the Hunter app, so I don’t really need the switch to control them both. But I want a smart switch to prevent the power being cut to the device. 

What are your thoughts? 

Hope to hear back.

My set up in a bedroom is a ceiling fan with a light on it and a remote control to control both.  I originally had a 2 switch  wall outlet, one for the fan and one for the light.  I purchased a Wyze single pole smart switch because I wanted to get rid of the two switch setup since I use the remote after turning on the power to the fan. I connected the Wyze smart switch and it worked great for a month or so, but then all of a sudden, it started taking anywhere from 15 to 45 seconds for the fan light to come on when turning on the wall switch, which always turned on the light immediately when flipping the switch.  I first thought maybe a bad bulb, so I replaced that also. So, I thought it was a bad switch because they are inexpensive, so I took the Wyze switch out and replaced it with a Kasa smart switch.  Unfortunately, the light still takes many, many seonds to come on.   In my wall switch box, I had 3 white wires, one ground wire, one red wire and one black wire.  Should I be connecting the red and black together since I am only using the switch to power the light and fan, but use the remote to control it?   Can't understand why at first when I put in the Wyze switch, the light would come on immediately.   Scratching my head on this one. Would appreciate your advice on this one.

I purchased a Wyze single pole smart switch because I wanted to get rid of the two switch setup since I use the remote after turning on the power to the fan. I connected the Wyze smart switch and it worked great for a month or so, but then all of a sudden, it started taking anywhere from 15 to 45 seconds for the fan light to come on when turning on the wall switch, which always turned on the light immediately when flipping the switch.  I first thought maybe a bad bulb, so I replaced that also. So, I thought it was a bad switch because they are inexpensive, so I took the Wyze switch out and replaced it with a Kasa smart switch.  Unfortunately, the light still takes many, many seonds to come on.   In my wall switch box, I had 3 white wires, one ground wire, one red wire and one black wire.  Should I be connecting the red and black together since I am only using the switch to power the light and fan, but use the remote to control it?   Can't understand why at first when I put in the Wyze switch, the light would come on immediately.   Scratching my head on this one. Would appreciate your advice on this one.  Thank you very much for your time and help..",Positive,Positive

TW45ejyRIIc,Competitors,"This guy is 100% correct when he's stated to use a voltmeter to check for the line wire.

Note there is one other way to verify a line wire. Look into the electrical box. And find the black wires with one electrical cap. And one pigtail wire going to the light switch. (If there's two or more light switches there will be more pigtails. [If there's more than one electrical circuit. You might not find the correct line wire. Use a volt in this case. ]) That is normally your line wire. 

If you have one or two sets wires in the box you must use voltmeter for testing the line wire. 

But if you three or more sets of wires that usually means the circuit has more than item added to the circuit. Therefore you'll be able to find your line wire much easier without a voltmeter when necessary. 

But be aware the only pigtail could be tied to two separate lights that has a single set of wires to each light box. When you have one single light switch in one box. I still highly recommend using a voltmeter to confirm.

If you have more than one pigtail tied to multiple light switches that you have definitely been able to confirm that you have found your line wire.

Homes built before 1980s use a volt meter for sure. All the time. Unless you know it has been fully upgraded to the wires that we use today. 

But unless you're a professional I highly recommend that you always use a voltmeter.

If you don't have a voltmeter go to your local hardware store and buy one they're not expensive. Also a circuit tester will work.  And if you're not sure, how to still do it. Then hire a licensed electrician to do it. And learn from them on how to  correctly do it.
